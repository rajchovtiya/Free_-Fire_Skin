        <h1 class="text-[22px] font-bold text-blue-400 pb-4">Types of Property Insurance</h1>
        <p class="pb-4">Property insurance provides financial protection for property owners in the event of damage,
            theft, or loss. It covers both personal and commercial properties, and can include coverage for homes,
            buildings, and valuable assets. Below are the various types of property insurance:</p>

        <h2 class="text-[20px] font-bold text-blue-400 pb-3">1. Homeowners Insurance</h2>
        <!-- ------------- AD ------------------Code -->
        <div class="w-full" id="AD_class">
            <script async
                src="https://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js?client=ca-pub-7245399426452385"

            </script>

        </div>

        <p class="pb-4">Homeowners insurance is designed to protect your home and personal property against risks such
            as fire, theft, vandalism, and natural disasters. It typically covers the structure of the house, personal
            belongings, and liability for accidents that may occur in or around the home.</p>
        <ul class="list-disc list-inside pb-4">
            <li><strong>Building Coverage:</strong> Protects the physical structure of the home, including the walls,
                roof, and foundation.</li>
            <li><strong>Contents Coverage:</strong> Covers personal belongings inside the home, such as furniture,
                electronics, and clothing.</li>
            <li><strong>Liability Coverage:</strong> Covers legal liabilities for accidents or injuries that occur on
                your property.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 class="text-[20px] font-bold text-blue-400 pb-3">2. Renters Insurance</h2>
        <p class="pb-4">Renters insurance is for individuals who rent their home or apartment. It covers the tenant’s
            personal property against risks like fire, theft, and vandalism. It also includes liability coverage for
            accidents that may occur inside the rented property.</p>
        <ul class="list-disc list-inside pb-4">
            <li><strong>Personal Property Protection:</strong> Covers loss or damage to personal belongings inside the
                rented property.</li>
            <li><strong>Liability Protection:</strong> Protects renters from legal costs if they are responsible for
                accidents or injuries to others.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 class="text-[20px] font-bold text-blue-400 pb-3">3. Commercial Property Insurance</h2>
        <p class="pb-4">Commercial property insurance covers business properties, including buildings, inventory,
            equipment, and furniture. This insurance protects businesses from property damage caused by fire, theft,
            vandalism, and natural disasters.</p>
        <ul class="list-disc list-inside pb-4">
            <li><strong>Building Coverage:</strong> Covers the physical building and structure of the business premises.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Contents Coverage:</strong> Covers business assets, such as machinery, computers, and inventory.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Business Interruption:</strong> Provides compensation for lost income if the business cannot
                operate due to property damage.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 class="text-[20px] font-bold text-blue-400 pb-3">4. Landlord Insurance</h2>
        <p class="pb-4">Landlord insurance is designed for property owners who rent out their properties. It covers
            damage to the building and loss of rental income due to unforeseen events such as fire, natural disasters,
            or tenant-related damage. This insurance can also provide liability coverage in case a tenant is injured on
            the property.</p>
        <ul class="list-disc list-inside pb-4">
            <li><strong>Building Coverage:</strong> Protects the structure of the rental property from damages caused by
                covered events.</li>
            <li><strong>Loss of Rent:</strong> Compensates landlords for lost rental income if the property becomes
                uninhabitable.</li>
            <li><strong>Liability Protection:</strong> Covers legal expenses if a tenant or visitor is injured on the
                property.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 class="text-[20px] font-bold text-blue-400 pb-3">5. Condo Insurance</h2>
        <p class="pb-4">Condo insurance (also known as HO-6 insurance) is for condominium owners. It typically covers
            personal property inside the condo, liability protection, and any improvements or renovations made to the
            unit. However, the condominium association usually provides coverage for the exterior and common areas of
            the building.</p>
        <ul class="list-disc list-inside pb-4">
            <li><strong>Personal Property Coverage:</strong> Covers personal belongings inside the condo, including
                furniture and electronics.</li>
            <li><strong>Liability Coverage:</strong> Protects against legal claims resulting from accidents or injuries
                that occur inside the condo.</li>
            <li><strong>Loss Assessment:</strong> Covers your share of costs if the condominium association’s insurance
                policy doesn’t cover all damages to the building.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 class="text-[20px] font-bold text-blue-400 pb-3">6. Flood Insurance</h2>
        <p class="pb-4">Flood insurance provides coverage for property damage caused by flooding. Most standard property
            insurance policies do not cover flood damage, so purchasing a separate flood insurance policy is essential
            if you live in a flood-prone area.</p>
        <ul class="list-disc list-inside pb-4">
            <li><strong>Building Coverage:</strong> Covers the structure of the property from flood damage.</li>
            <li><strong>Contents Coverage:</strong> Protects personal belongings inside the property from flood-related
                damage.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 class="text-[20px] font-bold text-blue-400 pb-3">7. Earthquake Insurance</h2>
        <p class="pb-4">Earthquake insurance provides coverage for property damage caused by seismic activity, such as
            earthquakes or tremors. Like flood insurance, earthquake coverage is usually an add-on or a separate policy
            from a standard property insurance policy.</p>
        <ul class="list-disc list-inside pb-4">
            <li><strong>Building Coverage:</strong> Covers damage to the structure of the property caused by an
                earthquake.</li>
            <li><strong>Contents Coverage:</strong> Covers personal belongings inside the property that may be damaged
                due to an earthquake.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 class="text-[20px] font-bold text-blue-400 pb-3">8. Builders Risk Insurance</h2>
        <p class="pb-4">Builders risk insurance, also known as course of construction insurance, covers buildings under
            construction. It protects against risks such as fire, theft, or natural disasters that may damage a
            construction project before it is completed.</p>
        <ul class="list-disc list-inside pb-4">
            <li><strong>Construction Coverage:</strong> Protects the physical structure of the building while under
                construction.</li>
            <li><strong>Materials Coverage:</strong> Covers construction materials, tools, and equipment at the building
                site.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 class="text-[20px] font-bold text-blue-400 pb-3">Conclusion</h2>
        <p class="pb-4">Property insurance is essential for safeguarding your home, business, or other valuable assets.
            Different types of property insurance offer coverage for specific risks, so it’s important to choose the
            right type of policy based on your needs. Whether you are protecting a home, rental property, or commercial
            building, property insurance provides financial security and peace of mind against unexpected events.</p>
