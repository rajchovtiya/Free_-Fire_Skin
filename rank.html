        <p class="pb-4">Child Insurance Plans are life insurance policies that offer financial protection for your
            child's future. These plans ensure that in the event of the parent's unfortunate demise, the child’s future
            remains secure with funds available for education, marriage, and other important milestones. They also
            provide an opportunity for savings and investment, which can grow over time to help achieve long-term goals.
        </p>

        <h2 class="text-[20px] font-bold text-blue-400 pb-3">What are Child Insurance Plans?</h2>
        <p class="pb-4">Child Insurance Plans are designed to secure the future of your child in terms of education,
            marriage, and other major expenses. These plans typically offer life cover for the parent (usually the
            policyholder) and provide a lump sum or periodic payouts to the child in case of the parent's demise.
            Additionally, the child may receive a sum assured at the time of maturity, which can help meet future
            financial goals.</p>

        <h2 class="text-[20px] font-bold text-blue-400 pb-3">Key Features of Child Insurance Plans</h2>
        <ul class="list-disc list-inside pb-6">
            <li><strong>Life Coverage for Parent:</strong> The policy provides life coverage for the parent, ensuring
                the child's financial future is protected in case of the parent's untimely demise.</li>
            <li><strong>Premium Waiver Benefit:</strong> In case of the parent's death during the policy term, the
                future premiums are waived off, and the policy continues to accumulate benefits for the child.</li>
            <li><strong>Child’s Financial Security:</strong> The child receives the policy benefits when they need them
                most, such as for education, marriage, or other milestones.</li>
            <li><strong>Investment Option:</strong> Some child insurance plans come with an investment component that
                helps grow the policy’s value over time. These can be either traditional or Unit Linked Insurance Plans
                (ULIPs).</li>
            <li><strong>Flexible Payout Options:</strong> Payouts can be structured as lump sums or periodic payments,
                depending on the child’s future financial needs.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 class="text-[20px] font-bold text-blue-400 pb-3">Types of Child Insurance Plans</h2>
        <ul class="list-disc list-inside pb-6">
            <li><strong>Endowment Plans:</strong> These plans provide life cover along with the benefit of accumulated
                savings. They pay a lump sum at maturity, which can be used for the child’s future needs.</li>
            <li><strong>ULIPs (Unit Linked Insurance Plans):</strong> ULIPs invest the premium in various market-linked
                instruments, such as stocks and bonds, allowing the policy’s value to grow with market performance,
                while also providing life cover.</li>
            <li><strong>Traditional Child Plans:</strong> These are non-participating insurance plans that offer a sum
                assured along with bonuses (if applicable). They provide guaranteed payouts to the child on policy
                maturity or death of the parent.</li>
            <li><strong>Education-Centric Child Plans:</strong> These plans are specifically designed to fund the
                child’s education, offering regular payouts at key education stages, such as school and college.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 class="text-[20px] font-bold text-blue-400 pb-3">Benefits of Child Insurance Plans</h2>
        <ul class="list-disc list-inside pb-6">
            <li><strong>Financial Security for the Child:</strong> In case of the parent's untimely demise, the child’s
                financial future is secured with guaranteed payouts and insurance cover.</li>
            <li><strong>Education Funding:</strong> These policies provide funds for the child’s education, which is
                often a high priority for parents.</li>
            <li><strong>Flexible Payouts:</strong> Depending on the policy, the child may receive lump sum payouts or
                regular instalments when they reach key milestones such as higher education or marriage.</li>
            <li><strong>Premium Waiver:</strong> If the parent passes away, the future premiums are waived off, ensuring
                that the policy continues to remain active for the child’s benefit.</li>
            <li><strong>Investment Growth:</strong> Many child plans, especially ULIPs, offer investment opportunities
                that help grow the fund value, providing additional returns for the child’s future needs.</li>
            <li><strong>Tax Benefits:</strong> The premiums paid for child insurance policies are eligible for tax
                deductions under Section 80C, and the maturity benefit is generally tax-free under Section 10(10D) of
                the Income Tax Act.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 class="text-[20px] font-bold text-blue-400 pb-3">How to Choose the Right Child Insurance Plan?</h2>
        <ul class="list-disc list-inside pb-6">
            <li><strong>Define Your Goal:</strong> Understand whether you need a policy that covers education expenses,
                marriage, or other long-term goals for your child, and choose accordingly.</li>
            <li><strong>Evaluate the Insurance Cover:</strong> Make sure the policy offers adequate life cover for the
                parent and sufficient benefits for the child’s future.</li>
            <li><strong>Check for Investment Options:</strong> If you want the policy to grow over time, consider ULIPs
                or endowment plans that offer both insurance and investment returns.</li>
            <li><strong>Understand the Payout Structure:</strong> Evaluate the payout structure (lump sum vs. periodic
                payments) to ensure it aligns with the child’s future financial needs, such as tuition fees or marriage
                expenses.</li>
            <li><strong>Compare Charges:</strong> Understand the various charges, including administrative, premium
                allocation, and fund management charges (for ULIPs), to ensure that the returns are not heavily impacted
                by high fees.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 class="text-[20px] font-bold text-blue-400 pb-3">Tax Benefits on Child Insurance Plans</h2>

                deductions under Section 80C of the Income Tax Act, up to a limit of ₹1.5 lakh annually.</li>
            <li><strong>Tax-Free Maturity Benefit:</strong> The sum assured along with any bonuses or investment returns
                received at policy maturity is typically tax-free under Section 10(10D), provided the policy meets the
                conditions laid out in the Act.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 class="text-[20px] font-bold text-blue-400 pb-3">Eligibility Criteria for Child Insurance Plans</h2>
