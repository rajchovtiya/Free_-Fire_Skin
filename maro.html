        <p class="pb-4">Health insurance plans are designed to provide financial protection against medical expenses
            incurred due to illness, injury, or unforeseen events. These plans cover hospitalization costs, medical
            treatments, surgeries, diagnostic tests, and much more, offering peace of mind and ensuring that you have
            access to quality healthcare when you need it the most. With the rising healthcare costs, health insurance
            is essential to safeguard your finances.</p>

        <h2 class="text-[20px] font-bold text-blue-400 pb-3">What are Health Insurance Plans?</h2>
        <p class="pb-4">Health insurance plans are policies provided by insurance companies that cover medical expenses
            for illnesses, injuries, and surgeries. These plans offer financial assistance to policyholders in case of
            hospitalization, outpatient treatments, preventive healthcare, or critical illness coverage. Health
            insurance plans may also include coverage for routine checkups, vaccinations, and emergency medical
            services.</p>

        <h2 class="text-[20px] font-bold text-blue-400 pb-3">Types of Health Insurance Plans</h2>

                package. Group health insurance is typically cheaper than individual plans and covers a wide range of

                network.</li>
            <li><strong>No Claim Bonus:</strong> Many policies offer a No Claim Bonus for each year you do not make a
                claim. This increases the sum insured for the next policy term without additional cost.</li>
            <li><strong>Sub-Limits and Co-payments:</strong> Some policies have sub-limits for specific treatments or
                co-payment clauses where the policyholder has to bear a part of the claim amount. These clauses should
                be reviewed carefully.</li>
